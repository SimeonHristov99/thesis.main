## Resources

- [How Do I Handle Insecurity about My Writing Ability?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6L0WP3Kjn7o)
  - Takeaways:
    1. De-emphasize the writing aspect of you putting together your dissertation. Stop using writing the only verb you use to describe you working on your dissertation.
    2. 80% of your efforts should go to thinking and experimenting. Figuring out what you want to say and make it worth saying. Do experiments, look at what you have discovered, come up with even better experiments, understand the literature, figuring out the thing you want to say is 80% of the work and where the value comes from. 20% is writing that down in a way that people can understand.
- [How Can I Use Time-Blocking To Help Write My Dissertation?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XFC034DvKk)
  - Takeaways:
    1. Schedule less. Don't be too ambitious with putting tasks on your to-do list during the period of dissertation writing.
    2. Be consistent but also be less ambitious on how much you're going to do each day.
    3. Try to ritualize this. Use the same times, probably first thing in the early morning, same place, same setting.
